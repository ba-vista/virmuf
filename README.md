# VirMuF: Virtual Museum Framework

VirMuF (Virtual Museum Framework) is a Unity [custom package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Packages.html) for creating your own virtual museum without having to write code. You have a set of tools for interacting with artifacts, such as light exposing, cross-sectioning, reconstructing missing parts, animating moving parts, and distance measuring,. You can also view information and hear narration. Using this framework, you can show the world your collection of ancient artifacts digitally without requiring your visitors to travel. You can also hold the artifact in your hand, which you are never allowed to do in a real museum!

[Bibliotheca Alexandrina](www.bibalex.org) (BA) initially started development of VirMuF as part of the VI-SEEM project with [Horizon 2020](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-2020_en) funding by the European Commission.
